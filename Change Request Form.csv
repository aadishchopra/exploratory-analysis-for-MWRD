Good morning,

The File System backup of the server VMPERFAP is currently in a pending state. It appears the CommVault services may not be running.

I am unable to get any response from the console (no login window when I try to send a Ctrl + Alt + Del.) Patrick also had the same results when trying to connect to the virtual machine. The server is responding to ping requests.

Would it be possible to set up a time today to reboot this VM? Please advise.
